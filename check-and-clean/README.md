# run-dir-cleanup
Scripts for checking and cleaning Illumina instrument run directories.

There are two components to cleaning run folders.

1. checking for problems
2. cleaning the run 

The most time-consuming process for the user is checking for problems. It involves examining the output of the checkRunBeforeClean script, looking it over, doing an initial diagnosis on the problems if they exist, making tickets and flagging the run on the filesystem, and then sending it for cleaning. Cleaning also takes a long time but it's hands-off once it is launched.

The two main scripts are checkRunBeforeClean.py and cleanRun. All other scripts in this directory are called by those.

## Dependencies

* A clone of [illlumina-run-dirs](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/illumina-run-dirs)
* For checking: Python 3 with module [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
* For cleaning: bash on Debian
* Pinery webservice
* JIRA (by default, points to jira.oicr.on.ca)
  * JIRA configuration file: ~/.jira or set under JIRA_AUTH_FILE with private permissions. The file should consist of one line that is your JIRA personal access token (https://jira.oicr.on.ca/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens)
* FPR file provenance report

Each service is contacted in its own python module: pinery.py, fpr.py, and jira.py. Each module has a method get_sequencer_run(s) that retrieves the data, and decisions which returns a 100 or 0 if the run checks out okay, or another number if an error occurred or the run can't be cleaned automatically.

# Primary scripts

## checkRunBeforeClean.py

The primary script for checking whether run folders can be cleaned is illumina-run-dirs/check-and-clean/checkRunBeforeClean.py.

It uses the name of the sequencer run directory to query OICR services to determine whether the run can be cleaned.

* Checks
  * whether sequencing is complete;
  * LIMS
    * if this run is marked 'failed'
    * if the run appears in LIMS at all
  * JIRA
    * If there are any open tickets that mention the run by name
  * FPR
    * if there are exactly two fastqs per library
    * if there are at least two fastqs per lane
    * if the fastq files exist on disk and are larger than 1MB
    * if the total size of the lane is less than 15G
* Works from any filesystem location
* Does not prompt for passwords; passwords are not hardcoded in the scripts.
* Prints results to standard out
* Does NOT take any cleaning action

Because of the requirement to authenticate in JIRA, this script should be run as yourself and not an instrument user (e.g. sbsuser).

If you must run using an insecure account, set the JIRA\_AUTH environment variable (and make sure that bash history immediately forgets about it).

    history -d $((HISTCMD-1)) && export JIRA_AUTH='mtaschuk:************'



```
usage: checkRunBeforeClean.py [-h] --run RUN [--verbose] --username USERNAME
Searches for and reports the status of issues in JIRA
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --run RUN, -r RUN     the name of the sequencer run, e.g.
                        111130_h801_0064_AC043YACXX
  --verbose, -v         Verbose logging
  --username USERNAME, -u USERNAME
                        The username to use for JIRA
```

Example command lines:

```
python checkRunBeforeClean.py --run 180320_A00469_0007_AHCHTWDMXX --username mtaschuk
```



### Output
The script prints a single line (in non-verbose mode) to standard out with the following columns:

* Name of instrument run
* Decision (i.e. Clean/No Clean/Delete)
* Optional columns: if one or more services had a warning or rejected cleaning, briefly explain why. In the format SERVICE: Reason

Example:

```
110915_h239_0128_BC055RACXX     Clean
110927_h239_0130_AC0476ACXX     Clean   FPR: issues detected
111107_h239_0131_AC087PACXX     Clean
111118_h239_0132_AD080LACXX     Delete  Pinery: Not in lims; Delete, add to GP-596
111118_h239_0133_AD080LACXX     Delete  Pinery: Not in lims; Delete, add to GP-596
111124_h239_0134_BC06GFACXX     No Clean        FPR:No Clean
111209_h239_0135_BD0GRMACXX     No Clean        JIRA: Open tickets      FPR:No Clean
111216_h239_0136_AD0E6RACXX     Delete  Pinery: Not in lims; Delete, add to GP-596
111222_h239_0137_AD0DDNACXX     Clean   Pinery: Failed run
```

## cleanRun
Removes all of the large data from a run directory

* Check whether the name of the directory matches an Illumina sequencer name
* Removes:
  * sgeLogs
  * ReadPrep1/2/Images
  * AnalysisLogs
  * Calibration*
  * finchResults / finch_results
  * Cleans contents of directories named: postProcessing; GERALD*; BaseCalls; Intensities; Bustard*; *Firecrest*; Data
* Reports the total size of the directory after cleaning and any files larger than 1GB in size

## checkAllClean
This script is intended to be run from an instrument directory that contains many run directories. For example,

    sbsuser@hn3:/.mounts/labs/prod/archive/m753

This will quickly list run directories that contain the CLEANED.TIM file (produced by `cleanRun`), indicating the run dir has been cleaned, or without CLEANED.TIM indicating the run dir needs to be cleaned.

## cleaned

This is the last script that is run in the process. It generates a 'CLEANED.TIM' file (or appends to an existing one) that describes the size footprint of what remains. This is useful for older run dirs where someone may have created temporary files that don't fit the cleaning pattern and remain to be cleaned.
